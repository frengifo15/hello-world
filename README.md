# Hello everyone

## Hi my name is Fatima! 

I'm 19-years old and a Sophmore in college. I have some experience with creating a webpage and using specific symbols to make them appear fun and joyable to read.
A few of my hobbies I would say is makeup :lipstick:, I **love** because it gives me the chance to create anything I want and it's easy to erase any mistakes that I didn't like and start over. Makeup isn't just a hobby to me, it's an aspect I cherish in my life and seeing anyone happy with a look I created for them makes me happy enough to continue to become better everyday and learn from it.
